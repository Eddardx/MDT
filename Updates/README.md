# Important Note

These scripts are now replaced by a PowerShell module [LatestUpdate](https://github.com/aaronparker/LatestUpdate). The module is published to the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/latestupdate) making installation, updating and usage simpler. We highly recommend using the module instead of these scripts, as they will no longer be updated to support new Windows builds.
